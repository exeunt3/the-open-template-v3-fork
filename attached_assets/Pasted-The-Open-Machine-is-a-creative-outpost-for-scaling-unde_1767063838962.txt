The Open Machine is a [creative outpost] for scaling [underground values] alongside, within and through emerging technologies. We produce [media] & [events] and stage [research] on the actualization of extitutional social forms in the twenty first century.

Institutions (in their dominant form as centralized, administrative bureaucracies) are known to concentrate power, homogenize culture, enshittify technology, obscure empirical conditions in favor of party lines and, worse of all, generate cultures of complacency where direct empirical engagement with reality is sidelined for the [opiate coziness] of a protected inside
That structural logic may be dominant, but it’s far from the only means of organizing bodies. 
The Open Machine is premised on an alternative mode of social organization, a semi-formal set of values and operational principles we refer to as the [protocol underground]. 

In an age of ascendant [existential technologies], the emergent principles of the [underground] are in a position to scale to conspicuous dominance as cynical actors and obsolete formulas fall beneath the compounding increase in degrees of freedom the new forms provide. 

The Open Machine is here to midwife that process. Our work is to discover [alignment] and build [coalitions] (and lineages) around key underground values. This also means recognizing the [open], [public] and [horizontally determined] nature of the values themselves.

[protocol underground] This refers to a collective of actors with no shared identity or structure beyond the open protocols that synchonize them in acts of discovery and interparticipation. See “Sketches for a Theory of the Protocol Underground” for the origins of this term.

[horizontally determined[ This final claim is a nod to the broader underground sense that intelligence itself is a network phenomena, multiparty discovery in non-coercive process.
